# Translations
Feel free to improve the English translation or other available translations. If you want to add a non-existing translations, add a .txt file with the language's name in that language. Copy and paste the english.txt text, in the first line change "English" with the language name in English, and start translating. Is it important not to change any line (don't add/remove lines), and try not to make long texts (specially with the button's texts).
